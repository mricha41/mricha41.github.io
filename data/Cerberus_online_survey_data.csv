Also if I'm working I can tell the person to go away.,I wish the dog couldn't hear the chime it makes. I would like it to be completely silent if I want it to be. It also needs to be charged pretty often.

4,1,1,1,,1,,1,,,0,1,1,1,,1,1,,1,1,,90,2,1,Solid connection (no disruption of service). Reconnecting has been problematic for us. Also need “auto record” when motion is detected. Another area of concern is sensitivity. Picking up the motion of a passing car on the street and sending me a notification is an issue (this is on the lowest sensitivity setting).,"Love having the ability to record after motion is detected. Also like to be notified of “true motion” at my door, ability to view when not at home as well as being able to communicate (2 way) with those at my door (even if I am at home).",Storage “in the cloud”. I am uncertain if this is occurring. I would prefer erasing old data on local storage device and on my phone only.
